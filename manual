this is a custome kernel for the cd-rom implementation of shellOS bot this will allow you to create top os over the existing one but warning do not create any from of virus or harmfull type of os
the file kernel.py is the loader of the os that will downlaod the file from your repo
and the CustOS is the os tat you can rename the file and create your own os that will be bootable from ShellOS bot

the 2 id that you will need if you want to create your own os for shellOS is:
967120742464499763
and
967120400003780611
but if ist for your own shellos bot distro you can use your own channel id
have fun creating and inovating shellOS bot :)
